### It's cheaper... because it's online?
Move over incumbent retailers, there is a new electricity retailer in town. One that
is offering up to 20% cheaper electricity because it's run from the internet. This
company comes with serious credentials:

 - They have raised over $52M in funding
 - Were voted world's best utility website in the world
 - Have partnered with ideaslab!, PETsMART.com and other big names

Today, I'm going to look at the rise and fall of utility.com. An online electricity
retailer in several US based deregulated markets. California, Nevada, Pennsylvania,
Arizona, Massachusetts and New York.

### Same Electricity, Lower Bill
Utility.com began in 1999, during the heights of the dot-com era boom. It's business
model was simple. Enter a deregulated market and sell product at a lower rate than
the encumbant retailer. They sold internet, telephone, gas and electricity services.
At times they were selling electricity for 20% less than existing market rates.

Their appearance in New York made the New York Times who had quotes from experts both saying
that making money would be difficult because "the margins are so slim on electricity" and 
"the company would be able to provide the average consumer with only a $3 to $5 monthly saving"

### Putting the $500 Billion electricity industry online
Initially things went well. After their initial fundraising, they raised $30m in April 2000.
The money was to broaden Utility.com's services wordwide. At this point it had already
expanded to 5 states in the USA. And despite their cheaper offering, they needed to
direct the cash directly into marketing at the states they were already present in.

### The Californian Energy Crisis
It was around this time, in May and June 2000 that the Californian Energy Crisis began.
Pool prices for electricity rose significantly, and there was a huge heat wave over June which
caused widespread blackouts.

In the midst of this, Utility.com announced their "Powerful Tips" for keeping power outages at bay.

 - Raising the air conditioning thermostat
 - Switching off unused lights and machinery; and
 - Leaving the house

Most were aimed at their consumers shaving off peak usage, and so reduced Utility.com's exposure
at times of peak pricing. 

By October 2000 the wheels were falling off the energy business, and they had changed their focus.
Instead of selling power to mums and dads, they were selling their electricity retail software to
other power companies.

At this point in November 2000 they raised another $22m dollars to expand and shift their
focus to selling software to power companies. No longer burdened with selling discount
electricity to consumers this was seen as a way to avoid certain disaster. 

### The fall
The crisis in California, driven by Enron was deepening. Other electricity companies folded
and Utility.com stopped accepting new customers. It was too late though. In early 2001 they
exited the market all together and released the customers back to the default retailers.

However court rulings found that they owed significant sums of money to their old customers.
During their peak, utility.com had 130 employees and over 50,000 customers. At the end
only 15 remains including Chris King the founder and CEO who now runs a division of
Siemens.

Was Utility.com becoming a victim of the California Energy Crisis the only possible outcome?
They certainly were exceptional circumstances to operate a business, coupled with the 
difficulty they would have had in raising further capital in the declining post boom
market.
