### Residential solar has utilities worried in California
Since the Enron situation, California has used a new tariff structure to protect
residential electricity customers. Their tariffs differ in that they don't have
a monthly supply charge. If you don't use any electricity, you don't pay anything
that month.

Instead what they have is a four tier electricity rate structure. Your usage
is divided up into baseline, low, high and higher usage tiers. The baseline usage,
a known amount, is regulated at 50% of what an average consumer would use and
is charged at 13c/kWh. If you use more than your baseline, which is really only
enough to literally keep the lights on and fridge running then that usage is charged
at the higher amount of 16c/kWh. Both of these two tiers are regulated by
the central utilities body in California. However, should you use more than
those two tiers and become a higher using customer (e.g. a family of four) then
you'll be paying a rate that is set by the utility itself. The two higher tiers
are at 27 and 31c/kWh. 

Now you may consider this unfair to the family of four, however those on the
equivalent of a government health care card would get a mandated cheaper rate
(up to 30% off, which would almost remove any profit).

The remaining households that are large consumers of electricity have begun
to install solar in droves (over 1800 MW so far). And it made sense. 
Why pay over 27c/kWh when the post-subsidy cost of solar approaches 17c/kWh. 
And with no fixed charges many of these households would have had zero net usage,
and hence paid nothing whatsoever on their monthly bill.

### A new law is born
Well the public utilities commission has been looking into this problem for
a few years now, and recently proposed a bill that was signed into law:
AB 327, which allows for a restructure of tariffs and to include a fixed
monthly charge moving forward on residential customers. 

The bill allows for a maximum fixed charge of $10 per month, and increases to align with
inflation only. 

### The changes bring residential rate in line with what we expect
These changes won't save the utilities from the long term death spiral. We have
a similar set up in Australia with higher supply charges which hasn't prevented
a drop in the network provider's revenue from lower sales volume.

The goal of the various electricity regulations are to equitably distribute the
cost of providing electricity based on causation, while protecting those that
cannot pay. It turns out that allocating charges for electricity to satisfy
these constraints, and those of the private network owner's requirement to
shareholders is difficult to balance. So expect further changes in coming
years as we course correct.
