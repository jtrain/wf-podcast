### The Notrees Wind Farm Storage unit

Built into the remote Notrees wind farm site in Winkler County, West Texas is a quiet revolution
in wind. But no it isn't the wind farm itself that is breaking new ground.

The Department of Energy and Duke energy teamed up to pay equal parts $22m to Xtreme Power to build a
36MW battery storage installation.

The battery has a storage capacity of 24MWh or 40 minutes at full wind. 

Project purpose was to serve as a model for other entities to adapt and replicate.

The tech is lead acid batteries and went into service in Jan 2013.

Benefits listed as:

 - Congestion reduced
 - Energy dispatch optmized
 - Energy costs reduced
 - Grid reliability improved
 - Carbon emissions reduced
 - Wind energy knowledge advanced

Ercot reporting has revealed that there were some challenges fitting this new tech type into the market:

 - The dual nature of the generation and load mode caused problems with their systems for settlement and market operations processes

In an interesing twist. The batteries aren't being used to store power at all. At least not in the capacity
that I would have imagined. You see, when I hear battery tech, my mind immediately considers energy
arbitrage between low and high priced periods. Of which there are plenty in Texas.

But in a press release the Deparetment of Energy states that since Feb the battery has been providing fast-responding regulation service to the grid. 
It dispatches power in 1 minute intervals, up to a burst of three minutes in a row. 

Originally ERCOT envisaged only using 25-30 percent of power before recharging, but in practice pulled 90 percent at times.
It shows that they have confidence in the technology.

There are more storage devices planned for Texas including some as large as 290MW, though those use a lossy 
Compressed Air Energy Storage with a roundtrip efficiency below 30%.
