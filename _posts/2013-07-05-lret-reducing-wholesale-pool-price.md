Welcome to Episode #4, I talk to Ben Burge, the CEO of Meridian Energy Australia
and Powershop a brand new electricity retailer.

Ben spoke to me about how wind and renewable energy sources, incentivised by the Large-Scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) are
lowering the price we pay for electricity.
