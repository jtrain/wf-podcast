### A new business model for battery tech
California has a curious electrical rate system that is fostering the growth of the battery tech
industry. Mid sized businesses, ones that can consume over 200kW at their peak are subject to 
a payment known as demand charges.

What happens is that your hourly usage is monitored for the entire month, and
your maximum instantaneous power usage in the month forms the basis for your demand charge.
So if you can shave off your peak demand, you'll save money.

The Intercontinental in California has just finished a test trial. They installed
a large lithium ion battery, the same kind that powers an electric car or laptop.

Their hope was to avoid the expensive demand charges, and to cash in on green innovation grants.
The cost of the hotel's system was reported at $100k for a 54kWh battery. 

However the Californian Government will cover 60% of that cost. And the battery company
[stem](http://www.stem.com) installs the battery with no money up front, and instead
charges a monthly fee.

The question I have is, how much would a company typically pay in demand charges?

For a company that uses at peak between 200kW and 500kW they'll be on a rate which
charges $13/kW. Which puts the monthly demand charges between $2.5k and $6.5k.
Reducing that peak by 50kW would save $650 in the month, or $4k in a year if you
account for the lower winter demand charges. 

That number doesn't look so great compared to the cost of the battery. One of
the use cases was for when patrons want airconditioning turned on. Air conditioning
is a fairly sustained high load which the 54kWh battery wouldn't supply for very long.

### And yet people are buying into battery tech
And so I see this as further evidence of a utility death spiral. Future years will
bring cheaper batteries and more large business will install them to shave off their
peak usage. I see that perhaps these early adopters are arbitraging the dynamic rates
but once demand levels flatten out somewhat, utilities will raise off-peak rates
and there won't be such a disparity between peak and offpeak pricing, killing 
this golden arbitrage opportunity.

What do you think? Is this evidence that battery tech is taking hold?
