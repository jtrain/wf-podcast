### Over 40 Market Customers in Australia
There are over 40 registered Market Customers in Australia. These are people that buy and sell electricity from the
National Electricity Market on behalf of ordinary businesses and households. Origin, Energy Australia and AGL
are just the big three, beneath that sit second tier retailers like Lumo, Momentum and Red. Still further down
the chain are the niche retailers. These are companies that aren't looking to upset the market as a whole,
but they have tailored their branding and product to fit a small number of consumers.

Once such company, which applied to the AER to become an electricity retailer is "Pooled Energy" 

> POOLED ENERGY Pty Ltd is a privately owned company whose business purpose is the retailing 
electricity to owners and operators of Swimming Pools for the purposes of providing Energy 
Efficient, Safe Bathing while providing integrated Demand Management Services for the purpose of 
optimising electricity grid operations

Their plan is to:

> Pooled Energy is seeking an Authorisation to retail electricity to swimming pool owners 
and operators. 
 
> For approximately the first 12 months from commencement of operations, Pooled 
Energy (PE) will retail electricity primarily to small customers (residential households) 
with swimming pools. It may subsequently address other markets 

One impressive and perhaps surprising thing about this niche electricity retailer is that it
has some heavy weight directors: The former CEO of Worley Parsons, the former CTO of Honeywell
and the former Managing Director at McKinsey. 

So where can a niche retailer go in the NEM?
They can get purchased by a larger retailer. Greentricity was purchased by Australian Power and Gas (who is now being purchased by AGL)
for around $250,000.

> On 9 October 2006, the Group acquired 100% of issued share capital of Australian Power and Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd (formerly 
Greentricity Pty Ltd), with the consideration being 185,715 ordinary shares at a value of $84,500 and $165,500 in cash. 

You can attempt to grow big like Click Energy who switched 10,000 customers in Queensland and 20,000 customers in NSW as part of the One Big Switch
Campaign.

You can double down on your niche like WINEnergy, who control most of the embedded network electricity retailing. Embedded
Networks pop up in Shopping Centers, Retirement Villages and some large appartment blocks. No one that owns or rents
in these places have any choice in their retailer, they must purchase their electricity from WINEnergy.
