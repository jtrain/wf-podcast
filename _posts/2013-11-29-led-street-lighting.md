### Switch to LED street lighting against network's interest

An article by the Rocky Mountain Institute in the USA discusses a situation
where a disruption is happening in streetlighting of all all places.

I'll look into their findings and review the changes we are making here in
Australia.

In some jurisdictions, the council or roadways authority does not own the street lights
instead they are owned by the network. The council then pays an access fee and
a flat energy usage charge for the street lighting bundled in one. The problem arises with respect
to a perverse incentive. The network has little incentive to upgrade lights to use
lower wattage or more efficient globes or technologies. The revenue
comes at a time of low demand which is a perfect balance for their network. 
If they were to install a more efficient globe they would need to update the tariff
and pass the savings through to the council.

### Street lighting buy back
There are suggestions and an example that a public buy out of the street lighting
from the network will yield a windfall over a period of 20 years for the councils there.
Typically they'll issue 20 year bonds to fund the purchase as in the example
of the town of Union in New York State which saved around $13 million according to
a [2008 study](http://www.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/audits/swr/2008/streetlight/streetlighting.pdf).

### We run things a little differently here
In Australia the poles are owned by the councils and roadways authorities but 
these pay a maintence fee and energy rate to the networks. It is the network's 
resposibility to fix and maintain street lighting, but the council's responsibility
to upgrade to new technology if that is what they prefer.

A campaign in the last few years in Victoria sought to upgrade all of Victoria's
street lighting to newer efficient technologies, not LED but compact fluorescent. 
We predominantly have mercury vapour lamps installed which are 80W, but the newer
technologies can be half or quarter that energy use for the same light level.

But how much would we save? The campaign website suggests a $7M saving each year.
However I have an issue with that number. Here is how I'm calculating the costs:

Assuming 330 thousand lights are installed in Victoria, each has 80W globes installed
The lights run for 10 hours per night, and the electricity rate is 6 cents per kWh.

That calculation will gives an annual $5.7M electricity bill cost, a $7M yearly
saving would mean that the networks are paying the councils for running the lights.
We could save about half that amount, or $3M annually. The campaign said that
the upgrade would cost $120M, or $360 per light in Victoria. Which would take 
40 years to earn back. The Baillieu Government pledged $20M towards their goal,
then renegged in 2012.

### Uncertain economic benefits
The economic benefits look very slight, which is why the USA and trials in New Zealand
are not focussing on the economic benefit alone. They are taking the opportunity to
install sensors on the poles to monitor traffic, pedestrians and seismic activity.
