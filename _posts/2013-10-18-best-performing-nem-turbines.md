All studies run for periods between 20th Jun 2013 and 17 Oct 2013

### The best by capacity factor

- Hallet 1, SA, 50% (Installed Capacity 94.5 MW)
- Woolnorth, TAS, 50% (Installed Capacity 140 MW)
- Hallet 2, SA, 50% (Installed Capacity 71.2 MW)

### Dollars earned per MW of installed capacity
- Hallet 1, SA, 99k $/MW (Installed Capacity 94.5 MW)
- Hallet 2, SA, 97.5k $/MW (Installed Capacity 71.2 MW)
- North Brown Hill, SA, 88k $/MW (Installed Capacity 132.3 MW)

lowest three

- Musselroe, TAS, 51k $/MW (Installed Capacity 168 MW)
- Portland, VIC, 53k $/MW (Installed Capacity 164 MW)
- Starfish Hill, SA, 64k $/MW (Installed Capacity 34.5 MW)

### Wind Weighted Average dollars earned per half hour
- Cathedral Rocks, SA, $64/MWh (Installed Capacity 66 MW)
- Lake Bonney 3, SA, $63/MWh (Installed Capacity 39 MW)
- Lake Bonney 2, SA, $63/MWh (Installed Capacity 159 MW)

### Average pool price per half hour
- $55.13/MWh, NSW
- $58.58/MWh, QLD
- $68.07/MWh, SA
- $46.82/MWh, TAS
- $55.31/MWh, VIC

### Accounting for high prices in South Australia
The numbers look pretty rosy for South Australian wind farms, they
take the honours for most earned per MW installed and the wind weighted 
average dollars. Here are the dollars per installed MW number after
normalising the pool price to an average of $55/MWh for each state

- Gunning, NSW, 82k $/MW (Installed Capacity 47 MW)
- Woodlawn, NSW, 83k $/MW (Installed Capacity 48 MW)
- Woolnorth, TAS, 87k $/MW (Installed Capacity 140 MW)
