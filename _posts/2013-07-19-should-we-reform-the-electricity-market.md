Serious question. Should we reform the electricity markets? This week we look at the sweeping reforms tabled by the UK gov.

They began in 2010 with the lofty goals of secure energy supplies WHILE increasing low-carbon technologies.
And reducing the cost of electricity.

The reforms have undergone some consultation and in late 2012 was introduced as a bill into parliament.
It is likely that it will soon receive royal tip of the crown.

Will go into production in 2014.

Allegations of price fixing in UK gas markets has left people questioning the integrity.


So what will change? Surprisingly they've already got options on the table.


Contract for differences,

A capacity market

So what is a Contract for Difference in terms of the electricity market? It's like a hedge contract, a way to prevent market volatility. If I wanted to build a new wind farm right now. I'd need to demonstrate to the bank that I'd sold a large portion of my operating capacity (both in MW and renewable certificate terms) with contracts showing a steady price signal going out some years.

Banks aren't interested in taking a punt on the volatility of the wholesale market.

So the concept of CfDs already exists right now. How is what they've proposed any different? They are setting up an arms-length non for profit contract for differences entity that is compelled to make these contracts to purchase an amount of green energy set by the National Grid.

Wind farm operators wont need to deal with retailers to fix their strike price. Instead it they can contract with this entity.

CfDs will replace a mandatory renewables obligation similar to the one we have in Australia.


Capacity Market is a mechanism to pay load or generation to provide relief during times of system stress as identified by the system operator. The exact details haven't been hashed out yet, but would look like a system security event. An annual auction is run, and the winning bidders are obligated to be on call to provide the relief when called upon by the system operator.


Interesting questions. The reports claim that the CfD structured payments will be cheaper than the Renewable Obligation scheme because they'll provider greater price security and reduce the cost of capital. Normally the contract is between a generator and a retailer, because they both own the two physical sides of the equation. How will an independant body balance it's CfD payments? Will it enter into it's own contracts with load somewhere or auction off it's obligations to another party, acting as a kind of clearing house?
