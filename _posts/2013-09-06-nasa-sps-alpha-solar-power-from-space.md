### The SPS Alpha

Feasibility study conducted for NASA by Mr. John C. Mankins to determine whether 
a plan to collect solar energy and radiate back to earth as a power source should
continue

Report found that with current technology levels that the collection and distribution
of solar power may be economically feasible. Energy could be sent to earth at a cost
of 9c/kWh ($90/MWh)

The desire to build such a power system in space has been considered for decades,
however with a new planned biomimetic architecture the system may become economically feasible to build.

The proposed design a biologically inspired design which mimics an ant colony or bee hive rather
than the large monolithic design proposed since the 1960s.
