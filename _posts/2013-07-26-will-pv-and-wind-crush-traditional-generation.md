This week is Clean Energy Week. 

That fact alone explains all the talk I've been hearing about wind and solar becoming cheaper to build than traditional power plant. Giles Parkinson had a good write up at Reneweconomy. He notes that with generation replacement becoming a real issue over the next decade, that wind and solar will be the lowest cost alternative to replace them.

I wanted to talk about the reducing cost of wind and solar in the context of the recent reuters article that called the electricity market "unhelpful". 

On the one hand, we have Giles Parkinson backed by Bloomberg New Energy Finance's research that says wind and solar plant are becoming increasingly cost competitive. In fact, they claim that soon wind farms and solar plant will be built without the need for a power purchase agreement, something I spoke about last week.

Meanwhile Edward Hadas, an editor at Reuters contends that the price of electricity being so low as it covers the marginal costs would not adequately incentivise new generation entrants. And he claims that market prices alone *cannot* signal to our aims at preventing damage to the environment or to act as emergency reserve.

Hadas says that: 

> The market veneer confuses policy debates. Experts, not the market, will have to decide whether nuclear power is a good option, and whether the advantages of renewable energy sources justify their perhaps temporary additional cost.

I think this quote highlights the viewpoint. Hadas sees the market through a lens where large centralised stations provide the backbone of power. He talks about a natural monopoly in the poles and wires. Giles Parkinson's analysis points to a new tomorrow. Where power is produced in a distributed manner, through a network of smaller PV and wind plant. Already we've got more rooftop PV installed than Victoria's brown coal fired Loy Yang Power station. And the analysis points to 17GW total installation in 2030. That's two and a half times more than all the brown coal in Victoria combined.

So has the market done it's job? What do you think?
