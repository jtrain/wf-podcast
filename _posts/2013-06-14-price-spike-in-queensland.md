Welcome to Episode #1, inside this week's podcast:

- How much money revenue did all wind in Australia generate this week?
- What is really behind that 20% power price spike in Queensland?


### Mentioned in this podcast:

Dean Spaccavento from [mistervint.com](http://mistervint.com) where you can see
wind usage as it happens.

### The big question:

Do you think ENERGEX is experiencing the "Death Spiral"? Leave your comments below, and I'll read through on next week's show.

### Show Notes

$6.6M wind farm revenue was calculated from the following wind farm locations:

    'CATHROCK': "SA1",
    'CLEMGPWF': "SA1",
    'CNUNDAWF': "SA1",

    'GUNNING1': "NSW1",
    'HALLWF1': "SA1",

It was for the week between (Wednesday) 5th June and (Tuesday) 11th of June

#### Correction
In the podcast I mentioned that the wind industry earned $6.6M, but I left out Woolnorth.
Somehow it wasn't on the list. Including that rather large wind farm brings the total to $6.9M
