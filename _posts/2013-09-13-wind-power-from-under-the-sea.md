### Off shore storage in the most unlikely of places

We're often told that wind, solar and other renewables are lacking the consistant power producing capability that is required for stable power supply.

If the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, then we don't get any power. There have been plenty of proposals to plug the gap with grid scale energy storage.

Molten salt energy storage in the case of some solar towers. Wide spread Electric Vehicles storing all of our energy needs. Huge battery banks, and even compressed air storage in natural underground caves have all been listed as potential solutions. 

Today I'll speak about one more that has been added to the list, but we'll have to go under the sea to find it.

Alex Slocum from MIT has published a paper outlining a method for storing the power produced by offshore wind turbines. He proposes that huge 30m diameter dome or ball shaped concrete structures are built as an anchor for floating off-shore wind turbines. Inside the ball would be hollow, and could slowly be pumped dry of water. Then when energy is required and wind is low, water is allowed back in and rushes past a turbine which produces electricity.

This concept most likely falls squarely in the camp of pumped storage. We already have that in Australia and it's efficiency can be around 70%. What is novel, is that the ball would serve multiple purposes. Apart from energy storage, it would be the anchor for the wind turbine, and serve as an artificial reef for wildlife.

So while the turbine blades are busy killing seagulls above, the marine life are given a new home underneath.

Professor Slocum's research is only in early days yet. There have not been any commercial test pilots built.
