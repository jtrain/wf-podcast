### South by Southwest Eco Festival highlights

One particular startup that caught my attention was Fluitec Wind which have
developed a method for predicting turbine failures based on operating data.

Wind farm companies would use that data to conduct preventative maintenance.

Fluitec was awarded over $3m in clean energy grants.
