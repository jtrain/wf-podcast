### There is a lot of wind coming
AEMO is predicting a further almost 9GW of wind to be installed above our current 2.7 GW of wind
that represents a fourfold increase in wind over the next 6 years.
To put the level of wind in context, our minimum demand is currently 15GW, and the total
installed wind will be over 11GW.

For AEMO the most concerning aspect is that both South Australia and Tasmania's wind installation
rates will be far above the minimum demand in those regions. Installed wind levels are already higher than
minimum demand in South Australia right now.

### Wind Variation by the numbers
In 5 minutes an individual wind turbine output can sometimes vary by a lot.
At a wind farm level, the aggregated variation due to wind is less because the turbines are spread over a wider area.
Again at the state level the aggregated variation is lesser again and finally
taken at a NEM-wide level the variation in wind output is much lower.

AEMO have put some numbers next to these variations. They show that at the wind farm level
5 minute variations can be up to 10% quite regularly. At the state level this drops to around 
3.5% and finally at the NEM level it drops again to 2%.

### A constrained future
If 9 GW of additional wind were to be installed, our power system can handle it under
the current regime. AEMO suggests that stability could be resolved through use of 
constraints at times of low system inertia.

The report modelling suggests that from 10 to 30% of wind energy could be constrained.
The constraint types are two fold, the most binding constraint type was one where
there was so much wind produced that the system could not export all of it, so that's a thermal
constraint, and a lesser constraint was due to stability issues caused by the eind.

### Where to build and how to proceed?
I find it difficult to imagine that we are going to have 9GW of wind cramming themselves
into the same areas in the state, because that is what the wind resource map is telling them.
At some point someone needs to look at other planned and existing wind projects and the
capacity of the system itself to handle their production.

So my bet is on the market sorting themselves out to the greater extent. NSW, QLD and other
parts of Victoria (perhaps eastern rathern than western) will become more attractive to
developers that are looking to find their own unconstrained slice of network.

As to AEMO's use of constraints to solve the stability issue. This is technically feasible,
but is extremely difficult to build a business case around. Some of these wind farm project
sit on a knife edge with profitability. They cannot afford a 10% reduction in energy output
because of constraints. What is better is an up front plain english obligation on
developers. Something they can include in their business case. 

As we saw last week, it's hard enough getting generation investment in the NEM
without the risk of future constraints eating up profit margins.

### Big question
Where would you build a wind farm and why?
