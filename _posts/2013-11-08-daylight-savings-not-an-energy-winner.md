### The case for Daylight Savings Time

According to a recent article in National Geographic, Daylight Savings Proponents
claim that DST saves energy and so is good for the environment.

The theory is that because our day has more daylight hours, we use less lighting load
and we get out of the house more to enjoy the outdoors.

But it isn't true.  A 2008 National Bureau of Economic Research study found that
if anything usage increased slightly due to an additional hour of air conditioning load.
And an additional hour of driving increases environmental impacts there too.

### Meanwhile in Australia

I wanted to observe the effects of DST in Australia for myself. We have the situation
where Queensland does not observe Daylight Savings Time while the other eastern states do.

I compared the energy demand for the week before and after DST introduction in both
2012 and 2013. What I found was shocking.

There was no appreciable difference in demand levels before and after. Sometimes demand
went up, and in other states it went down. And the same is true of Queensland where no
DST change occurred at all. If there was any difference, it has been lost in the noise.

The debate in Queensland has some recency, since it is a relatively constant political issue.
The southeastern corner of Queensland supporting such a change while the north and western
parts weakly opposing. The Daylight Savings Time political party which was formed 
promoted commercial and lifestyle benefits and only made a vague reference to potential
energy savings.

So it seems that the original energy saving benefits which are rooted in the World War I
era have given way to more social and commercial benefits, meaning perhaps DST is
here to stay.
