Welcome to Episode #5, reported from some sources this week was a new maximum output
solar farms in Germany. I look into these claims, and try to understand how such
a large industry could be seen as "imploding".

### Mentioned in this podcast:

- [Forbes: German Solar Implosion](http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2013/07/08/germanys-solar-industry-is-imploding/)
- [Reported maximum in German Solar](http://cleantechnica.com/2013/07/07/breaking-germany-sets-solar-power-record-again-23-9-gw/)
- [Actual recorded german solar](http://www.transparency.eex.com/de/daten_uebertragungsnetzbetreiber/stromerzeugung/tatsaechliche-produktion-solar) You'll have to play with the graphs.
