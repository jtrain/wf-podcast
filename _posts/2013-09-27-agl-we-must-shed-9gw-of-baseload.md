### Michael Fraser AGL Managing Director says baseload needs to go
As reported by Giles Parkinson at RenewEconomy and others recently, Michael Fraser
made the comment that Australia needs to shed 9 GW of baseload generation, and more
peaking generation needs to be brought in. 

He says that slow demand growth and installation of rooftop Solar has put us in a
position of having too much baseload which adversely impacts new market entrants.

The statements were based on research by his economist Paul Simshauser. Their solution
to the problem is to introduce capacity payments that will incentivise new peaking entrants.

### We've seen this work from Paul before
Paul Simhauser's research isn't new. In fact, 7 years ago in 2006 Paul submitted 
an almost identical piece of research to the AEMC. In that piece he was again arguing for
capacity payments to be introduced, and reckoned that baseload generation was overweight.
Though at that time it was 3.4 GW overweight. His research showed that in 1998 at market
start we had a touch over 4GW too much baseload power.

### Why are we short of peaking generation?
In Simshauser's 2006 essay, he points at the volatile energy only market design as
being to blame. For a generator to get built, it must be able to show the bank that
it's capacity has been sold for many years out. But with high price events occuring randomly
it's much more difficult to price a peak contract. Retailers are reluctant to hedge
any significant amount of time in the future, because market conditions can change
so quickly. This is why vertical integration has become the key to succeeding in the
NEM today. However, despite the raging amounts of vertical integration, the level
of peaking generation has still fallen further behind what Simshauser defines as optimal.

### Why is there so much baseload generation?
We began the markets with a huge level of installed baseload generation, in the 15 years
since the market start a further 6 GW of baseload generation has been installed. Which
represents an increase of around 25%. That probably matches most industry expert's predictions
of load growth over the same period. Except the load didn't grow, we've had very slow
growth and an insanely high rate of rooftop solar installation both of which have 
exceeded expectations. 

Paul says that we are 9 GW overweight. His "optimal" baseload target is the same
level that was installed in 1998, that is around 20 GW. Meanwhile in 2006 he was predicting
that we'd need around 30 GW of baseload power today (which is the level we actually have).

Perhaps all that is happened is the classic disruption model. The incumbent suppliers become
extremely efficient at making and selling electrons from large centralised power generators.
They didn't see that rooftop solar would be a problem for them, until it was. Now
the NEM is charging full steam ahead towards an uncertain future where our electrons are 
produced on our roof, instead of in the La Trobe valley.

### How would a capacity market help?

Both in 2006 and now with two very different market conditions Paul has asked for a
capacity market to be developed. How would it help?
