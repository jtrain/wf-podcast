### Timeline to Success

Saul Griffith an Engineering PhD from Sydney co founded Makani power in 2006 with 
two others Don Montague and Corwin Hardham who has sadly passed away.
It was kick started with a grant from Google's Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal fund (Rec).

They set out to take a new approach to wind. They based their tech on a little known paper written in the 70s that described a new
method for getting power from the wind, using a kite.

According to Saul's presentation at a TED talk, a free flying wing will sweep through more air
in the same amount of time than a traditional turbine blade generating greater energy output.

He talks about the limit to the height of traditional masts being unable to extend much
further, though the higher you go the more wind you get.

Saul moved on in 2008, but by 2013, they'd managed to build a 30kW prototype model that was capable of hours of unmanned flight.
The small generators are located on the wing itself, and transfered to the ground by a tethered cord.

It wasn't disclosed how much Google paid, but they'd already put over $15m into the business thus far.
Their initial goal was to be cost competitive with traditional wind, since the Google acquisition it's unclear whether or not
they are continuing in that same direction.

Could you see 6MW turbines with wings the size of the spruce goose flying over offshore locations in Australia?
