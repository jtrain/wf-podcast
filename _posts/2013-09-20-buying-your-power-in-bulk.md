### Modern History of Group Buying
Ever heard of Groupon? That company that went public at a valuation over 10 billion dollars despite never having made a profit.
If not, here is a very short description of how it works:

A company approaches groupon to offer a discounted Coupon code for one of their products. Say balloon rides.
Groupon requires that all coupon codes are at least 50% off normal prices. Normal price for the balloon ride is
$400, but with the coupon the price will be $200 paid to Groupon. Group will keep half of that money, and the business owner
will collect only $100 of the originally $400 balloon ride.

Groupon was trading on a concept called group buying. The business owner wants a lot more customers
and hopes that some of the discounted customers will become regulars or "buy add-ons" like $90 for champagne on the
balloon ride. The customer just wants a cheap deal.

### The same happens in electricity
The exact same thing happens in electricity. Somers on the Mornington
Peninsula tried this out in 2010. The townsfolk signed a petition saying they
would switch electricity retailer as a group to the lowest bidder. They got 15% off
their rates, possibly similar to the rates that commercial buyers get for a chain of supermarkets.

A few Australian companies turned this idea into a company and got some press
and as many as 250,000 households checked them out (it isn't clear how many actually
switched retailer though).

###  But how do they make money?
The world of electricity brokering is full of kickbacks. For every new customer
that an iSelect or similar sends to a retailer, they get over $100. A company
that promises to switch a large group of customers over would also be rewarded with
a very large payday.

One such company The big switch started with electricity (it is now partnering with 
channel 7) and has since broadened it's reach to a group buying campaign for health insurance. The
health insurance kickbacks are over $300 per new customer, and home loan kickbacks can be over $1000.

### Are we alone?
The concept of group purchase isn't entirely new. Local co-operatives have existed
for years in the United States and in Europe, but their local focus doesn't give 
them the scale that the new campaigns have.

The UK has borrowed the big switch model and gotten significant press coverage and
the attention of local MPs who were very pleased to see the campaign.

I couldn't see similar schemes in the USA, but the concept is so successful here
and in the UK I can't see why it wouldn't do well there too.

### Big question for this week
Does knowing about the kickbacks change the way you view switch and save websites?
